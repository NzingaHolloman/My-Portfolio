        <h4>Hello Nzinga! App</h4>
        <p>This is the first App I have ever made with Android Studios.
            The user sees text in a label - Hello from Nzinga!, 
            User can tap a button to change the text color of the 
            label</p>

        <h4>2D Fighting Game</h4>
        <p>This project was designed for my a course on 
            Computer Programming Design. This game is on single player mode, 
            where the user is verseing a CPU. Both the user and CPU can 
            attack and move across the screen. there are health bars that 
            decrese what when an attack has landed on a player.
            The goal of the game is to make that CPU'S health bar run out. </p>
