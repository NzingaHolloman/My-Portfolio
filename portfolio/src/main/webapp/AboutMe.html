        <h2>The Journey to Computer Science</h2>
        <p>I was introduced to Computer Science during my first 
          semester at West Chester University of Pennsylvania 
          in fall 2018. At the beginning of my first computer 
          science course, I had no idea what was going on. 
          Later when I took the time to start programming on my own 
          there was an instant connection. After spending hours 
          working on a code and finally getting it running, 
          I get this amazing feeling that fueled my curiosity 
          and left a sense of pride.</p>
        <p> Although I did develop my love for programming at 
            West Chester University, the school it did not provide 
            me with the tools I needed at the rate I needed them. 
            By the start of the second semester, I knew I needed 
            more opportunities, so I decided to transfer. Now I am 
            surrounded by dedicated students open to new ideas at 
            the luxurious North Carolina A&T State University. 
            Can I get an AGGIE PRIDE!? </p>

        <h2>Things I love</h2>

        <h3>The Great Outdoors</h3>
        <p>Whether it is camping, skiing, cyclying, swimming, 
            hiking, running, or gardening, I LOVE it all.</p>
        <h3>Traveling </h3>
        <p>I have always been passionate about traveling, 
            because it satisfies my drive to learn and immerse myself 
            in new societies. It is important to my personal growth 
            that I can work and communicate across different cultures. 
            The valuable assets of respect, global awareness, and 
            acceptance will assist me in this increasingly globalized world. </p>
        <h3>Programming </h3>
        <p>This is probably not surprising coming from a Computer Science Student, 
            but I love coding and seeking additional exposure in the field. 
            Programming combines curiosity, adaptability, and individuality in a way 
            that drives me to learn new skills. </p>
