      <h1>The Journey to Computer Science</h1>
      <p>
        I was introduced to Computer Science during my first semester at West
        Chester University of Pennsylvania in fall 2018. At the beginning of my
        first computer science course, I had no idea what was going on. Later
        when I took the time to start programming on my own there was an instant
        connection. After spending hours working on a code and finally getting
        it running, I got this amazing feeling that fueled my curiosity and left
        a sense of pride.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I did develop my love for programming at West Chester
        University, the school did not provide me with the tools I needed at the
        rate I needed them. By the start of the second semester, I knew I needed
        more opportunities, so I decided to transfer. Now I am surrounded by
        dedicated students open to new ideas at the luxurious North Carolina A&T
        State University. Can I get an AGGIE PRIDE!?

      <h2>The Great Outdoors</h2>
      <p>
        Whether it is camping, skiing, cyclying, swimming, hiking, running, or
        gardening, I LOVE it all.
      </p>
      <h2>Traveling</h2>
      <p>
        I have always been passionate about traveling, because it satisfies my
        drive to learn and immerse myself in new societies. It is important to
        my personal growth that I can work and communicate across different
        cultures. The valuable assets of respect, global awareness, and
        acceptance will assist me in this increasingly globalized world.

      <h2>Programming</h2>
      <p>
        This is probably not surprising coming from a Computer Science Student,
        but I love coding and seeking additional exposure in the field.
        Programming combines curiosity, adaptability, and individuality in a way
        that drives me to learn new skills.
