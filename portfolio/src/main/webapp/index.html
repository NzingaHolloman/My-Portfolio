        <p>Hello! Welcome to my portfolio.</p>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        
        <h3>The Journey to Computer Science</h3>
        <p>I was introduced to Computer Science during my first 
          semester at West Chester University of Pennsylvania 
          in fall 2018. At the beginning of my first computer 
          science course, I had no idea what was going on. 
          Later when I took the time to start programming on my own 
          there was an instant connection. After spending hours 
          working on a code and finally getting it running, 
          I get this amazing feeling that fuelled my curiosity 
          and left a sense of pride.</p>
        <p> Although I did develope my love for programming at 
            West Chester University, the school it did not provide 
            me with the tools I needed at the rate I needed them. 
            By the start of the second semester, I knew I needed 
            more opportunities, so I decided to transfer. Now I am 
            surrounded by dedicated students open to new ideas at 
            the luxurious North Carolina A&T State University. 
            Can I get an AGGIE PRIDE!? </p>

        <h3>What I love</h3>
        <h4>The Great Outdoors</h4>
        <p>Whether it is camping, skiing, cyclying, swimming, 
            hiking, running, or gardening, I LOVE it all.</p>
        <h4>Traveling </h4>
        <p>I have always been passionate about traveling, 
            because it satisfies my drive to learn and immerse myself 
            in new societies. It is important to my personal growth 
            that I can work and communicate across different cultures. 
            The valuable assets of respect, global awareness, and 
            acceptance will assist me in this increasingly globalized world. </p>
        <h4>Programming </h4>
        <p>This is probably not surprising coming from a Computer Science Student, 
            but I love coding and seeking additional exposure in the field. 
            Programming combines curiosity, adaptablity, and indivuality in a way 
            that drives me to learn new skills. </p>
        <h2>My Projects </h2>
        <h4>Flash Card App </h4>
        <p>A basic Flashcard app that can display a question 
            then respond to a user's tap to display the answer to 
            the question. I used Andriod Studios for this program and 
            the language is Java.<p>

        <h4>Hello Nzinga! App</h4>
        <p>This is the first App I have ever made with Android Studios.
            The user sees text in a label - Hello from Nzinga!, 
            User can tap a button to change the text color of the 
            label</p>

        <h4>2D Fighting Game</h4>
        <p>This project was designed for my a course on 
            Computer Programming Design. This game is on single player mode, 
            where the user is verseing a CPU. Both the user and CPU can 
            attack and move across the screen. there are health bars that 
            decrese what when an attack has landed on a player.
            The goal of the game is to make that CPU'S health bar run out. </p>
