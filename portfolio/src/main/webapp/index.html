              <h2><b>Hi! Welcome to my portfolio.</b></h2>
              <hr />
              <p>
                I am a Computer Science student at the illustrious North
                Carolina A&T State University.
              </p>

              <p>
                I started my computer science journey at West Chester University
                of Pennsylvania. At the beginning of my first computer Science
                course, I honestly had no idea what was going on, but later when
                I took the time to start programming on my own there was an
                instant connection. After spending hours working on a code and
                finally getting it running, I get would get this amazing
                feeling, that fueled my curiosity and left a sense of pride. As
                the school year progressed, saw the impact that technology has
                on the world, and the ability it has to change it for the
                better. Since then I have transferred to the #1 producer of
                African American undergraduates in Engineering, North Carolina
                A&T State University for their Computer Science program.
                Currenty I am being challenged, enlightened, and prepared for
                success.
